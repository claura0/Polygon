# Polygon

## Description
Polygon is designed to draw geometrical shapes which includes rectangle, rhombus and isosceles trapezoid. The user can choose the shape they want to work with and input the required measurements to calculate the area and perimeter.

## Compiler
The program is compiled using g++.

## How to Use
After compiling the user can choose among these options:

1 - Create a rectangle

2 - Create a rhombus

3 - Create an isosceles trapezoid

4 - Draw

5 - Exit

By choosing 1-2-3, the user can proceed inputting information of the geometrical shape wanted (for example width).
After creating shapes, the user can choose to draw the shapes or exit the program.

## Features
- Rectangle: calculating the perimeter and the area of a rectangle by inputting width and length.
- Rhombus: calculating the side, the area and the perimeter of a rhombus by inputting horizontal and vertical diagonals.
- Isosceles trapezoid: calculating the side, the area and the perimeter of an isosceles trapezoid by inputting top side, bottom side and height.
- Draw: drawing geometrical shapes input.

## Limitations
The program can draw up to 100 geometrical shapes. As soon as the user reaches this limitation, the only choices left are "Draw" and "Exit".

The data input (widths, lengths, diagonals, sides and heights) must be positive numbers.
